"""PyTorch compatible DataLoaders

Essentially we extend PyTorch DataLoader by adding the ability to save the
data loading state, so that a checkpoint may be saved in the middle of an
epoch.

Example
-------
>>> import torch
>>> from speechbrain.utils.checkpoints import Checkpointer
>>> # An example "dataset" and its loader
>>> dataset = torch.randn(10, 1)
>>> dataloader = SaveableDataLoader(dataset, num_workers = 3)
>>> # Setup the checkpointer:
>>> tmpdir = getfixture('tmpdir')
>>> checkpointer = Checkpointer(tmpdir, {"dataloader": dataloader})
>>> # Iterate:
>>> for i, data_point in enumerate(dataloader):
...     # Here you would process the data:
...     rainfall_amount_prediction = data_point * 4.
...     # Now, imagine the experiment gets killed on the fifth batch:
...     if i == 4:
...         break
...     # Luckily, you had just saved a checkpoint:
...     if i == 3:
...         _ = checkpointer.save_checkpoint(end_of_epoch = False)
>>> # So when you restart the experiment:
>>> new_dataloader = SaveableDataLoader(dataset, num_workers = 3)
>>> new_checkpointer = Checkpointer(tmpdir, {"dataloader": new_dataloader})
>>> _ = new_checkpointer.recover_if_possible()
>>> # The dataloader fast-forwards to the position where we left off:
>>> assert next(iter(new_dataloader)) == dataset[4]

    Note
    ----
    1. The saveability is implemented via some unfortunately slightly magical
    means.
    2. The data loader cannot recover after entering __iter__. Normally this is
    not a problem, as recovery should happen before training begins.  However,
    just before evaluation, it is also typical to recover the checkpoint at
    which performance was the best. Thus, if a checkpoint is loaded after
    entering __iter__, we just assume it is for this reason. A warning is
    logged, but that is all.
